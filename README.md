# Overview

This is a ready-to-use skeleton project for IONIC v1 based on the work done for [this demo app](https://github.com/jdat82/learning-ionic).

See this [README](https://github.com/jdat82/jumpstart-ionicv1-tabs/blob/master/template/README.md) file for a better understanding of what 
it can do for you.

# How to proceed ?

> For true beginners: You need to install node.js which is required by almost any modern web tool nowadays. 
I recommend to use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) on a mac or an equivalent for windows in order to easily switch between node versions.

## Generate a project

First install some global dependencies:

```bash
npm i -g jumpstart jumpstart-ionicv1-tabs
```

Then generate a project:

```bash
jumpstart <your_path> ionicv1-tabs
```

You will be prompt a few questions like your app name, bundle id and version.

Then go in the generated project to start using it. I strongly recommend to read the included [README](https://github.com/jdat82/jumpstart-ionicv1-tabs/blob/master/template/README.md) in order to understand everything this starter kit has to offer. 
It contains also a list of prerequisites for novices and explain how to start using it.
